    "comment": "The erosion of our personal securities has to end.  The government has already gone too far invading our homes with unwarranted surveillance of our phone calls, emails and Internet communication.  The last semblance of security and privacy that we have is encryption, much of which the government has already circumvented, through back doors and spending taxpayer dollars to build massive compute clusters capable of decrypting some of the strongest encryptions in a reasonable period of time.\n\nBut here we have a device that too many of us own that has been designed well with our privacy in mind.  The designers did not hold back a secret key, to be leaked into the wild and compromise that security.  The designers protected our interest, we the people.  Yet even her and now the government seeks to force the designer to, not turn over the key, but to create new software, software that is capable of pretending that there was never any security on the device to begin with.  To think that once this exists, that this will be the only time it is used is naive and ignores history.\n\nOnce this code exists, case after case will continue to come in each justified on it's own rights as a few believe this case justifies.  At first it will just be the FBI, but then it will spread.  The number of cases will become so great that it is unreasonable to keep the software contained and limited in it's use, it will become commonplace in every police station across the country.  And at that point, if you believe that it will not have leaked to those who truly seek to harm us, your are far too trusting.  Yet even in the hands of the FBI, who leaked the personal information of 20,000 employees this year alone, cannot be trusted to protect a piece of code so potent.  The personal information that we store in our phones will be available to anyone who truly wants it.\n\nAnd if the FBI can compel Apple to build new code, new product that enables the Government to collect more information on those not accused of a crime, without a warrant, without due process, what then will the Government be able to compel.  Will all of our connected devices be required to send information on us back to be reviewed.  Will LG be required to install cameras in it's refrigerators, GE install listening devices in our ovens?  If Apple can be compelled to build new code, new product in the name of security, then they will have the power to compel anything and we will be powerless.  \n\nWhile some say this case justifies this to happen, I say how.  Are we preventing the attack, that already occurred that was not stopped in spite of the massive invasion of our privacy that has already occurred.  That occurred due to the ineptitude of those who were alerted to the warning signs but did not act.  They already have the power to collect the same information, had they acted before the attack.  This is not about protecting us this is about the FBI being frustrated.  Frustrated that there actually is a device that gives freedom.  Frustrated that they failed to protect us from this attack when all the signs were there, when all the information existed.  This is about control.  Control of the flow of information, our information, the information about our lives.  The attack happened.  Those guilty have been found one executed the other tried and sentenced to death.  This is not about this case, this is about the ability.\n\nWhat do we store on our IPhones? Why is the government so interested in having this ability.  Our phones have access to our entire lives.  Our phone knows where we have been and often where we are going.  Our phones have access to our money and our credit lines.  Our phones can see and hear us.  Our phones know our friends and neighbors, those we talk to and communicate with.  Our phones know our hobbies and our passions.  Our phones know our history.  There is almost nothing about us that our phones do not know.  \n\nOnce the code to expose that information exists, anyone will be able to know us, as our phone does."

There is no search warrant for my brain and no law that would allow police to coerce me into revealing any thoughts or ideas I have if I am accused of a crime. In fact, most countries have laws that protect you from exactly that - for good reasons.

Because once the key is made, it will not be long before it is abused. And then everyone will be worse off for it. We have the right to privacy, and the right to protect our personal information, and back doors or special keys will put everyone at risk of having their identity stolen, their life's work destroyed, their bank accounts plundered.

We need more digital security going forward, not less.  If a group other than the FBI was attempting to break into Apple's security using a backdoor, it would be seen as hacking and compromising security.  The court order puts the FBI in the place of being the attacking entity, working overtime to breach security and digital integrity of Apple's products.  Normally the good guys are on the side of principal and protection of our right to privacy, free speech, and security.  There is only a chance opening up 'the' phone will provide any valuable evidence that could prevent any other harmful activity, but forcing this back door to be created will guarantee that harm has been done to everyone that owns an Apple product and to everyone else who is effected by this precedent.

And yet, astoundingly, the government's efforts to wrangle ever-more power and rights away from the American people continue to intensify.\n\nThis latest move against encryption is easily the most frighteningly misguided effort to date. It threatens to harm American business, opens us to attacks from cybercriminals, and serves as the naked harbinger of a brave new totalitarian ambition fit to rival China's. It is dangerous above and beyond the relentless erosion of human rights that it represents.\n\nTo the court: I beg you to put your foot down on behalf of the people.

But the problem is that the FBI wants access to all phones. That's a no no. Consider this: if a law enforcement investigation required access to a home, through the proper channels they could get the landlord to grant them access. Understandable. But what if the same law enforcement group said, \"You know what, just give us keys to all of the homes and we'll just let ourselves in.\" That is not a good situation for me, you, or anyone else to be in! And I have nothing to hide! Forcing Apple to violate it's consumers' privacy is giving the FBI a skeleton key to ANY APPLE PRODUCT they want, whenever they want, whatever the reason -- justly or unjustly. And it won't stop there. You know it won't. Whenever a precedent is set, it can be abused many times before it's overturned. The problem with having a ruling on the books is that foreseeing all of the potential harm it could cause was absent in determining the judgement. Because remember, this is not a physical skeleton key. This is software. This is tech. And it's always under attack. So if Apple is FORCED to make their products LESS SECURE, then it is less secure to EVERYONE, regardless of their intentions. And for people with the know-how, or governments with the resources, a less secure target may be just what they need to execute whatever plans they had in the first place. Do not force Apple to loosen it's security. Even I don't have the foresight to see all of the hazards waiting down the road. But I do have the foresight to see that a decision that is not in favor of Apple and not in favor of maintaining strong security - and our privacy - is a bad one."

These people have contributed nothing and do not deserve any kind of acquiescence to their impertinent and arrogant demands for snooping rights to telecommunications around the world. Their bid to crack one 'phone is a red herring to every 'phone   presently in use and all others into the future based on the ineptitude and hidden agendas of those in positions of power in America. Nobody is fooled by this ploy. Nobody is fooled by the judiciary pretending to be independent when there are too many instances of travesties of justice documented in America being swept under the carpet by politically appointed doyens of law. The government in America is deeply flawed as is its huge plethora of state minions.

There is not a week goes by in Australia when some offical is discovered improperly accessing a government computer, from Police to public servants.\nSecondly, Australian banks for a long time have put obstacles in the way of ordinary customers setting foot inside a bank. They want all transactions to be online. All my banking is now done online and this means my data will be more easily accessible to all and sundry. Of course the miscreant hackers are clever at data collection. You see it every day.\nNonsense to say that such a lessening in computing security would only be used in extreme cases. It is the thin end of the wedge.\nThe US legal and justice system must be made to realise they are playing with the whole world's data security protection.\nI presume my concerns are echoed in the US.

It is of the utmost importance that Apple win this fight and set a precedent that the FBI cannot just bully its way into getting whatever it wants. "

Nor does it have access to information in our heads unless it's given during interrogation. Why can't an encrypted phone be any different?

In the United States of America, we are supposed to be free.  Giving any governmental agency, entity, or employees access to our private property and/or data is a clear violation of our rights and freedoms.  The FBI cannot extend their responsibilities to the American people.  Encryption is a protection that is absolutely necessary and should not be broken to make the FBI or anyone else's job easier.  Today, I read an article in the St Paul newspaper, the Pioneer Press, which stated that an ISIS related hacking group released the personal information of many St Paul police officers, putting their families, communities, and themselves in grave danger.  Given the current vulnerabilities of online data, how could anyone argue against encryption?  Unless, it wasn't about safety or protection at all, and instead, was about power and control, used to violate the people's privacy and use it against them."

Apple even volunteered to help them.

It was the FBI's own stupidity that caused the problem, and they should not be allowed to force Apple to create a tool that would allow them to access any iPhone.

A government that allows little or no privacy is a destructive government, as history has shown. For example, when people's privacy is intruded upon by corporations, it gives those corporations the knowledge and power to target people for sales and monetary gain, and to control trends and buying patterns: in effect, telling people what they want or not, what to do and think. Governments should not have that power any more than corporations should. Think about it."

Theft of information can be just as damaging if not worst than theft of actual possessions. This would allow for more identity theft/fraud. With all the recent hacks that have been happening throughout the world why would anyone want to give would be hackers an advantage. Code embedded in a devices that allows circumvention (even if only intended for use of the \"good guys\") can be discovered and exploited. Much like reverse engineering a physical product to see how it's made and replicate or modify it. Code can be viewed in certain situations in the attempt to find the way in. All it would take would be access to a device with the aforementioned code (in the FBI's world everything made) and then scrub it. When you own the device and have unlimited access it would only be a matter of time to find the exploit. Then the information gets distributed throughout the world. It would be discovered and \"fixed\" but after how many lives are ruined, destroyed, or private photos released, etc... Having already been given to the world. Once that information is out on the internet there is no putting it back, making it unseen, or undoing the damage.

The iPhone you want unencrypted was a work phone for the male terrorist and has no information on it that would be of value to the government. That work phone could be required to be turned into his employer at any time.  If he's smart enough to smash his terrorist phone, he's also smart enough not put anything of value on his work phone. Please make your ruling in favor of Apple. "

Then by attacking two whole countries to punish the hand full of religious zealots the hand full has been multiplied many thousand fold and we now are told we face a never ending war. The initial overreaction was a colossal mistake. We should admit it and apologize to all the people we have killed, maimed and displaced and limit any future responses to punishing the people who actually attack us and stop offering absolute freedom from attack at the expense of the loss of ever more rights that are the most precious part of being an American.

Rather their expertise and suggestions could be a foundation for greater security for us all. \n\nThere are many sources of information available to make educated decisions.

You think you have a crime and cybersecurity problem now? Just wait until no phone, no device, is secure."

The FBI can't even protect their own data, so how are we to trust them with the ability to get into any of our devices. We live in a digital world now that is constantly being threatened by hackers and cyber criminals around the world and thankfully Apple has taken the proper steps to provide it's customers with strong security and encryption to help keep all of us safe. The FBI Director Comey has made it very clear that the FBI will continue to abuse the All  Writs Act to \"return to the courts in future cases to demand that Apple along with other private companies to assist...in unlocking secure devices\" They are already lining up at the courts with hundreds of iPhones that they want to force Apple to break into. Where does it end......They are trying to take our right to privacy away from us and we must stand together to save our right to privacy. "

    "comment": "Weakening encryption on any level shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Information Theory. \n\nIt's not unidirectional:\nYou cannot weaken encryption without dramatically weakening the security around ALL activities based around that encryption. If the FBI can break into an ISIS iPhone on a whim, then ISIS can (or very soon will be able to) break into an FBI iPhone on a whim. \n\nIt's an international move:\nIf the U.S.A. requires that Apple make a universal iPhone key, then (regardless of the continued existence of that key) other countries will have precedence to request the same of Apple. There are many countries for which it is not in the best interest of the U.S.A. that they have a universal iPhone key (Russia, North Korea, South Korea, China... any under-developed nation... the list of morally dubious countries goes on and on). \n\nIt won't stop the bad guys:\nEven if you can decrypt an iPhone, you cannot necessarily decrypt the app-by-app data on that iPhone. Apps such as Telegram are an example of this. Ignoring this, illegal activity will just move off of iPhones to other phones that the U.S. cannot control. Do we really need to give Russia and China more economic power?\n\nIt will help the bad guys: \nOnce the box is open, anyone will be able to use its contents. The U.S. is already inundated by information security threats from China, Russia, etc. Purposefully weakening our shields is a terrible idea that will only let more of these attacks be successful. \n\nYou don't think it will get out?\nThink again. There is not a single example in the history of information technology in which a purposeful flaw was not eventually discovered. How do we know this? Old software goes open source where it is analyzed by thousands of competent programmers. It gets out. Apple is a huge company and many people would have access to this universal key. If it's not leaked by an Apple employee, there's still the issue of the FBI, then the other countries that Apple must now give a key... The number of trustworthy people required explodes. \n\nThe case specifics don't require it:\nThe iPhone in question belongs to the government anyway, so our shooter was unlikely to keep sensitive information on it to begin with. Ignoring that, there's every indication that this guy was pretty isolated in his workings. Even more so, the case is done -- new information is highly unlikely to contribute any value to the investigation WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. \n\nIt will literally kill people:\nSocietal health is a funny thing. For example: the recession literally took many unseen human lives. You don't see this on a person-by-person basis, but rather across the population as a whole. How many people ate low quality food for a few years? How many people lost their health care? How many people didn't see the dentist for a decade? These factors reduce a person's lifespan, and across the whole population, many thousands of years of life were lost as a result -- as a direct result of the recession. In this case, weakened security will allow for more data leaks, more hacks, more impersonations. This will add friction to the economy and companies will have to funnel more money into fraud protection and IT security. That will mean fewer jobs, which means worse off people. People who are victims of identity theft suffer massive stress and financial strife. This has consequences. It will create more dead people. \n\nIt will academically weaken the U.S.:\nAside from the manufacturing weakening from fewer people buying Apple products, there will be academic problems. Forcing Apple's hand will feed into the rise of anti-encryption sentiment. This could cause other encryption legislation to pass and weaken encryption in the U.S.. Encryption is a field in Information Theory which is a sub-field of Applied Mathematics. It is purely abstract and mathematical. To forcedly weaken encryption is akin to forcing physicists to pretend all atoms are actually pentahedrons. Will this change the true nature of atoms? No. Will it stop science from studying atoms in their full context? No. What it will do is force the science to move abroad. The U.S. will become a weaker academic power if encryption is weakened. All those hundreds of thousands of international students that come here? Some still will. Some will opt to go to Sweden, Russia, Japan, China... Get the idea? \n\nThere is no valid position for the mandated weakening of encryption. Apple is right, the FBI is power-hungry, and there is no controversy. "

I work in finance and law and every day countless customers have their identity compromised as victims of identity theft and we deal with at least 5 people that have instances of this. They have to fill out identity theft affidavits and their credit history and criminal record as well as social security earnings records affected. This is not a joke and every day more and more people, citizens, Americans fall victim to phishing scams, data breaches and hacks. Whether that includes Target hacks, Home Depot, Sony or OPM we have a right as consumers and people of the United States of America to privacy and unencumbered, unaltered high quality products that protect that right of privacy and safety and security. If we sacrifice our rights and hard earned freedoms in the name of fear and the perceived threat of terrorism whether real or not then the terrorists have already won. We must not set a dangerous precedent that could potentially take back our advances and hard work and innovation at the cost of our liberties. Otherwise we might sacrifice the very essence of what makes us Americans and if so may God help us all. "

In all probability there is absolutely nothing of use on the phone in question. More to the point. the FBI could have gained access to the phone  itself, but it purposely ruined the opportunity, in order to press for this much more egregiously abusive and outlandish bid for power, and to destroy privacy, by setting an utterly appalling precedent. This is despicable. Comey is simply lying through his teeth, in his attempt to completely subvert the\nconstitutional right to be free from search and seizure, for everyone, without a warrant. The Obama regime and its \"Justice\" department are acting in a treasonous manner, for the continued ability to exert fear and repressive power over ALL US citizens. Even the other \"security\" agencies have come out against this staggering overreach attempt to destroy privacy and encryption. Even the agencies that have themselves engaged in massive abuse of power, such as the NSA, have come out against this. They know that if encryption is destroyed the country is at much greater risk for attack, on many different levels, economic, infrastructure, military, cyberspace...\nThe FBI is also acting against the interests of US tech corporations, whose foreign markets (not to mention their domestic ones) depend on the ability of purchasers to buy products in whose security they can trust. The FBI intends to undermine precisely this security, putting not only individuals, but the entire US tech business world, at great risk. People and businesses will not buy products from companies whose products they believe are compromised. That is precisely what FBI/Comey/Obama intend to do. The FBI/Justice department demand is a sick, subversive, and thoroughly destructive demand to obliterate our security to benefit the power held by a few. It should be shot down, as treason, and a vicious attempt at economic sabotage, by people and groups in power intent on subverting our democracy and destroying our economy. In short, it is a demand by terrorists."

Instead of making us safer, it would make us less safe. The U.S. cannot count on always being ahead in technology, in access to technology and information, and in having the best hackers (technically, crackers) on the planet working strictly for us. I strongly suggest to the FBI, an agency which I respect, that the next time they need access to an iPhone they allow only those trusted individuals and teams who actually understand iPhone security procedures to have anything to do with the iPhone(s) in question. The FBI screwed up their own access to the information from the San Bernardino shooter's work iPhone. They can learn from this, but the lesson should not be to make it possible for outside forces to hack in to anybody's iPhone. After all, if Apple were to comply by creating a backdoor, couldn't that in itself potentially be used by an enemy to erase or falsify information on an iPhone of potential future interest to the FBI, or to other security agencies? I encourage the FBI to work with Apple rather than against Apple, pay attention and get their own procedures in order for the future. Thank you for reading my comments."

I am not for any Federally mandated back door for any device which has been secured for the person who spent a considerable amount of money for this type of security. The bigger issue in this saga is the fact people were able to buy Ak-47's yes the guns every American thinks is their right to own under the 2nd Amendment. This is the real issue and this case is just causing more smokescreens other than dealing with the real issue at hand which is three security/justice agencies not doing their JOB #doyourjob .

As ever more of our lives become digitally recorded, and as our nation becomes more interconnected, the threats to our civil liberties and to the very structure of our democracy ---to say nothing of the extreme threats we all might face if this technology were to fall \"into the wrong hands\"--- these threats are very real and they are tremendous.

And, even if there is other information needed, there are many other ways to approach getting this information.  Why take the most bombastic, invasive approach, which has such powerful security-related implications down the line?  This should not be an either/or argument.  Both sides are, to some degree, correct.  Both sides should start working together on an approach that enables the kind of access requested without compromising security.  Installing backdoors into systems is what hackers and dark-netters do.  We need to spend more time in the light, as equals and collaborators.  "

Imagine creating a skeleton key that can be replicated by people in every country, copied a hundred million times  in a second and used untraceably  from anywhere in the world to open EVERY bank account, safety deposit box and personal record.   This is a multi-trillion dollar heist.  The pressure is unbearable on anyone who has access to the technology, however tangential and brief.  Their life and family are at high risk when it is worth losing an Army division and a Naval fleet to obtain this key.  \n\nThe US government already allowed access to the files of everyone with a top secret clearance - a back door into phones will guarantee enough leverage to coerce a substantial percentage of these good people.  \n\nI personally would not allow this software to happen if it cost my life and that of my family, and I would kill you too to keep it from happening for the greater good.  \n\n\nBesides, the bad guys already have access to strong encryption so this will hardly help law enforcement or homeland security.   If you do not understand this, then you should not be making any decisions about computer security."

All it takes is one person involved to release the program and boom, everyone can.\n\nAs such, you can only either have security or no security. You cannot have \"security with a backdoor\" because such a security program is no longer any form of security at all. It doesn't work that way.\n\nSecurity is necessary to protect national security.\n\nTo cripple the very functionality of security in order to \"protect\" us, they must put all of us in danger. This isn't simply creating a hazard; this is creating a hazard that is guaranteed to get exploited and will immediately guarantee harm to citizens.\n\nBy doing this, instead of protecting us, they are actually harming the very people they claim to protect...ergo defeating the entire purpose of the order.\n\nTo top it all off, secure communications have always been a thing since the pen and paper days. Papers were written with encryption that you had to have the decryption key to read. This was before computers even existed.\n\nTo break security just means that the criminals and terrorists will now just use pen-and-paper encryption to communicate...and the innocent bystanders who were put at risk will have had their security breached for literally zero gain.\n\n\nPlease stop this madness and don't let the knee-jerk \"I must know absolutely everything about everyone or terrorists will strike!\" statements of the FBI rule our country.\n\nThank you for your time."

Protest and rebuke are useless, a waste of breath. . . .  Hate evil and love good, then work it out in the public square. . . .  Go out into the streets and lament loudly!  Fill the malls and shops with cries of doom!  Weep loudly, 'Not me! Not us! Not now!'  Empty offices, stores, factories, workplaces.  Enlist everyone in the general lament. . . .

Software doesn't care if you are a part of the government of a malicious entity the backdoor will allow access to anyone that finds it. Backdoors do NOT stay hidden they are eventually found and exploited. An analogy to this is a communications protocol used EVERY day https, when you connect to a website with https your connection is ENCRYPTED against eavesdropping, this allows for secure payments, online shopping/purchasing, and securely accessing websites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Gmail, anything that requires an account or online profile to be created uses ENCRYPTION. Now invision a world where all of this encryption was made pointless by a backdoor. Identity theft would be rampant, no one would be able to prove their identity at a secure signin for a website, and networks would be drastically more vulnerable to intrusion. The world as a whole and the Internet itself would be turned man-kinds greatest invention to a tool and weapon capable of launching world-wide identity theft and deplorably more insecure networks. I urge that encryption be saved as it is the only way to properly secure and verify the integrity of information both for the end user of a device, for networks large and small, and for information traveling across the Internet."

    "comment": "Encryption is an important barrier to protecting our data and giving us privacy. They say, \"if you have nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear\" and some people say this. They say they have nothing to hide, so they're fine. What's the difference between that and the repeal of the 1st amendment because you've got nothing to say? As Edward Snowden said - \"Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say\". Cryptography has been done for millennials, even for the simplest of messages that if cracked, aren't that important. But why are they in crypt? Because they don't want an unintended guest reading it. Alan Turing, the father of Computer Science , wrote cryptographic messages, and even at a young age he did and some of the messages were simple and nothing worthy of hiding, he wrote it because he needed privacy. Mr. Turing committed suicide after being prosecuted for being a homosexual, when it's estimated that the work he himself and his small team did during the war shortened it by 2-4 years. Alan hid his homosexuality, now that is something he was hiding. But was a law against being homosexual just? No. We have laws today that aren't just. These laws can get thrown out in five years, but someone might be prosecuted for them in 3 years because their privacy was violated. Cryptographic messages have been done for millennials, as previously stated. They have been done by our own government, every high level member of our government has their phone encrypted. Do you think they have anything to hide in that text they just sent to their mother? No. Give them a personal phone that is unencrypted to use for texting their mother. Would they like that? No. Because they don't want the family issues they have in-house to get out, or the pictures they take, or the location of where they were previously to get out. Putting a backdoor and giving the government a secret key would give them immediate access to any iPhone in the United States of America. What do you have on your phone? Just your facebook? Email? It will take a hacker just a little bit longer to get into your phone, gain access to your email and do a password resets to change your password to multiple accounts. And how secure are your passwords? Do a lot of sites share the same password? Maybe have 4 passwords across 16 sites? The same password to 4 sites. Now tell me, how secure is your bank password? Your Verizon, Comcast, AT&T or Cricket password? All the same? Insecure? We may not have to hide these things from the government - why would they want those? They just want to read the messages. But we have to hide it from hackers and putting a backdoor in automatically puts a huge security hole in there. Got Chrome on your iPhone? Chrome stores your passwords to your email account, so when you attempt to login to your bank, it'll know the password as it's saved to the email. So hackers have so many things to exploit. Now, my conclusion. We have messages to hide because we have unjust laws - you know it's illegal to have possession of a Bald Eagle's feather? How the hell am I supposed to know the breed of the feather that I just picked up on the sidewalk? Now, if you are okay with them reading your messages - are you okay with a hacker getting into all your accounts? I know I wouldn't be. I oppose the FBI order."

This is a huge single point of failure, and jeporadizes everyones' security (not only those who use iPhones, but anyone who has to give up their private keys to the government). Even if there is no possible way that these keys would leave the database on accident, there is a chance of insider human maliciousness, not to mention the fact that the internet itself is held together with toothpicks and love, and that simply giving these keys to the US government is already a security risk to the people.

Its a normal security door, guarded at all times. Now this invasion force is massive, and dangerous. The ViPs are moved to the bunker, and everything is good. Then a hour later, the guards are dead, they were only a handful of guys with limited ammo, and resources, and the door is breached without even needing to try to penetrate the rest of the security. True it may help, it may not to have it. The problem is once its made you can't unmake it. You've weakened the entire complex's security to get at one point.

Consequently, the FBI will have worse relationships with popular technology companies and less recourse in future criminal situations than they have currently.  Instead of finding a way to investigate within the times, the FBI is trying to shape the times to their investigation.  This mistake has been made countless times in industry and now threatens to undermine the credibility of a distinguished government organization.  The highly publicized nature of the FBI's position and frustration with encryption has likely done more to promote the use of layered encryption tools and non-US-based encryption tools than any other means."
