  <h2 id="save-fair-use">Help us fight the copyright industry!</h2>
  <p>
    Thanks to everyone who took action, <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a> and <a href="http://www.channelawesome.com" target="_blank">Channel Awesome</a> are going head to head against the copyright industry this Thursday at the U.S. Copyright Office’s hearings on DMCA reform!
    We are up against industry lobbyists who are arguing for much worse copyright takedown rules, even though <a href="/stories/toc">takedown abuse is out of control.</a>
  </p>
  <p class="petition-statement">
    <strong>Will you back us up? Sign our petition demanding real reform to the DMCA takedown rules. Robots should never be allowed to takedown our content without regard for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" target="_blank">fair use</a>, and there should be an exemption allowing the use of copyrighted video &amp; audio clips up to 30 seconds long to allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_%28law%29" target="_blank">transformative work</a>.</strong>

  <h2 id="rally">Rally in SF outside the DMCA hearing!</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/124570707951268/" target="_blank"><strong>See our Facebook Event: Thursday, May 12 at 10am. 95 Seventh St, SF</strong></a></p>
  <p>
    For years, huge companies like Sony, Disney, and Comcast have been abusing the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) to take down enormous swaths of online content, using automated software that ignores Fair Use rights and frequently misidentifies music and videos as copyrighted. Despite the fact that the system is already weighted in their favor, these companies are arguing that the DMCA doesn’t go far enough to give them control over online content.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Thursday (5/12), the U.S. Copyright Office will be conducting a closed-door session with huge corporate copyright holders to discuss the future of the DMCA. They want to make it even easier to take content down and keep it down, turning the Internet into a graveyard for Free Speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fight back against takedown abuse by joining our rally outside the U.S. Copyright Office's DMCA hearing in San Francisco, 10am May 12th at the James R. Browning Courthouse, 95 Seventh Street, San Francisco, California 94103
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't let the internet turn into a free speech graveyard! The rally will have a "free speech graveyard" theme, so remember to bring themed signs like, for example, a tombstone shaped protest sign.

  <h2 id="why-this-matters">What's at stake</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet flourishes because of all of the stuff people make and share. But, there's a force that has kept works off the Internet entirely,
    making it so that there's a whole host of content that most us never get to see or hear.  The current notice and takedown system for copyright
    unnecessarily
    allows for abuse. With the current DMCA rules, copyright holders can censor and takedown practically any online content,
    just by <strong>saying</strong> that it infringes their copyright&mdash;no court order or oversight required. <strong>It's time to bring fair use back to the Internet.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The DMCA was created to help curb
    piracy, but all too often it is abused to censor content with valid free speech or fair use rights. Video and music creators are having their
    work taken down and their income stolen by big corporations who bet that nobody has the legal resources to challenge them. And even when people
    successfully challenge a takedown and get their work restored, oftentimes there is lasting harm done to their reputation or income.
  </p>
  <p>

    It's time to take a hard look
    at the DMCA. A clear fix to the current system is to impose penalties on corporations who abuse the DMCA by issuing false takedowns.
